# TODO LIST

## DESIGN

- console application
- language of choice: C#
- inputs are validated
- areas of implementation (at least 4 required)


- demonstrated scenarios must include 4 steps:
  1. empty UI at the beginning
  2. takes inputs
  3. validate outputs
  4. support input changes
  5. successful completion

- evidence of working application
  - video showing the chosen areas of implementation
  - evidence of compilation and correctness

## TODO

1. Determine the areas of implementation. (done)
2. Create project structure. (done)
3. Divide tasks. (done)
4. Create objects with empty methods
